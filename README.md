🛡️ Phishing Email Detection System

A machine learning–based system that simulates phishing email detection using Naive Bayes classification and TF-IDF feature extraction.


🎯 Overview

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to detect phishing emails by analyzing email subject lines and message content. It provides a simple but effective simulation of how automated phishing detection systems work in real-world cybersecurity applications.

Objectives

Create a labeled dataset of phishing and legitimate emails

Train a machine learning classifier for phishing detection

Extract textual features using TF-IDF

Evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics

Simulate phishing detection through user input

🔬 Models & Methodology
Feature Extraction

TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)

Converts email text into numerical feature vectors

Reduces importance of common words

Highlights distinctive phishing-related terms

Machine Learning Model
Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)

Suitable for text classification problems

Fast and lightweight

Performs well with TF-IDF features

Used as the primary classifier in this project

Evaluation Metric

Accuracy: Measures overall correctness of predictions

📊 Results
